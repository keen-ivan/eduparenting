# Eduparenting

## üìù Project Description

Eduparenting is a web application designed to be a comprehensive digital assistant for parents, helping them actively participate in and track their children's educational journey. The core problem this project addresses is the challenge parents face in staying organized and engaged with their child's learning, often leading to missed opportunities for support and a lack of clear insight into their progress.

Our proposed solution is a centralized platform where parents can access educational resources, view a child's learning progress through an intuitive dashboard, and manage lessons and activities. The prototype provides a structured, easy-to-use interface that empowers parents to become more effective partners in their child's education.

### Prerequisites

You must have the following software installed:

* **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
* **npm** (Node Package Manager)
* **Git**

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YourGitHubUsername]/eduparenting.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd eduparenting
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project has separate dependencies for the frontend (`client`) and backend (`server`). You'll need to run `npm install` in each directory.

    * **Install backend dependencies:**
        ```bash
        cd server
        npm install
        ```

    * **Install frontend dependencies:**
        ```bash
        cd client
        npm install
        ```

4.  **Environment Configuration:**
    This project uses environment variables to handle configuration. Create a `.env` file in the **root** of the project and add your Firebase configuration details.

    * Create a file named `.env`.
    * Add your Firebase configuration to it:
        ```env
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=[Your_Firebase_API_Key]
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=[Your_Firebase_Auth_Domain]
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=[Your_Firebase_Project_ID]
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=[Your_Firebase_Storage_Bucket]
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=[Your_Firebase_Messaging_Sender_ID]
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=[Your_Firebase_App_ID]
        ```

5.  **Run the application:**
    Now you can start both the frontend and backend servers. Open two separate terminal windows.

    * **Start the backend server:**
        ```bash
        # In the server directory
        npm start
        ```

    * **Start the frontend development server:**
        ```bash
        # In the client directory
        npm start
        ```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.
